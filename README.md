> Dead simple, **S**elf-**C**ontained, single-file **API** load testing tool built on FastAPI.

A lightweight tool for ad-hoc API testing. It generates controlled request loads, customizes headers and payloads, collects latency metrics, and runs anywhere with minimal setup â€” just launch and start testing.

## Features

- **Zero Configuration** - One file, one command
- **Self-Contained** - Uses uv's inline metadata format
- **FastAPI Swagger UI** - Beautiful Swagger UI interface;
- **Async Load Testing** - Built on httpx (encode) and asyncio
- **Real-time Results** - View metrics in stdout during execution
- **Container Ready** - Works in any environment (uv handles it)

## Quick Start

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) with the official script or via pip if Python is available on your laptop or server.

### Option 1: Run Directly (No Installation)

```bash
# Download and run the tool directly
curl -LOs https://github.com/sesav/scapi-py/releases/latest/download/scapi.py
uv run scapi.py

# Or with wget
wget https://github.com/sesav/scapi-py/releases/latest/download/scapi.py
uv run scapi.py
```

### Option 2: Install as Package

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install scapi-py

# Run the tool
scapi
```

### Option 3: Install with uv

```bash
# Install with uv
uv add scapi-py

# Run the tool
scapi
```

### Usage

1. Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
2. Use the `/load` endpoint to send requests
3. Check `/results` for metrics and response times

## API Reference

### POST /load
Send load test requests to a target URL.

**Parameters:**
* `url` (string, required) - Target URL to test
* `method` (string, required) - HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
* `attempts` (int, default: 10) - Number of requests to send
* `delay` (float, default: 0.1) - Delay between requests in seconds
* `headers` (dict, optional) - Custom HTTP headers
* `body` (dict, optional) - Request body for POST/PUT requests
* `response_header` (bool, default: false) - Include response headers in stdout
* `response_body` (bool, default: false) - Include response body in stdout

### GET /results
Get aggregated test results and metrics.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "results": {
    "200": 10,
    "404": 2
  },
  "average_request_time": 0.25
}
```

## Docker Usage

```bash
docker run -ti --rm -p "8000:8000" python:3.12-slim-bookworm bash
```
Then follow the installation steps inside the container.

## Limitations

It's important to understand that this is a very simple, single-threaded
application. Its purpose is to perform small, quick tests by generating a
limited number of requests, and it can run in almost any environment where the
uv binary is available.

Keep in mind that it only produces a limited number of requests per second. If
you need serious load testing at scale, consider more robust solutions such as
Locust, Apache JMeter, or similar tools.

## Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sesav/scapi-py.git

# Install development dependencies
make install

# Run tests
make test

# Run
make run
```

## Requirements
